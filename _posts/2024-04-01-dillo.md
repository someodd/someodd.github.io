Dillo is...

As of writing this article, Dillo in Debian 12's repo is, I'm told I think, 10 years old.

# Compiling Dillo

[An article on installing Dillo from the repo](https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo/blob/master/doc/install.md)

[Another article on installing/building Dillo from the repo](https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo/blob/master/doc/install.md)

Make sure the Dillo from the repo isn't installed:

```
sudo apt-get remove dillo
```

Clone the repo and set as working directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo
cd dillo
```

Install the dependencies (maybe more required, I can't recall, install as you find out what's missing):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev
```

You may want to ensure you have OpenSSL 1.1 or 3, I think, for HTTPS.

Now you can start the build process. I had an issue where Base64 encoded images didn't seem to work. [The Dillo browser account on Fosstodon helped me with that](https://fosstodon.org/@dillo/112194972182138353), so that's why I'm trying the `--prefix` flag here (they also recommended that the `~/.dillo/dpidrc` file has the `dpi_dir` properly set to the *dpi directory* in the installation, otherwise it won't be able to find the builtin plugins).

```
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
```

The summary from my `./configure` command looked something like this:

```
Configuration summary:

  CXX     : g++
  CXXFLAGS: -g -O2 -Wall -W -Wno-unused-parameter -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions

  TLS enabled: yes
  TLS library: OpenSSL
  TLS flags  : -lcrypto -lssl

  Cookies enabled: yes
  XEmbed enabled : yes
  RTFL enabled   : no
  JPEG enabled   : no
  PNG enabled    : yes
  GIF enabled    : yes

  HTML tests     : no
```

I should probably install one of the `libjpeg` packages I think.

After you've ran configure or whatever pay attention to what is supported or not, such as libpng and the like... Now you can finally build:

```
make
sudo make install
```

Try opening dillo:

```
dillo https://www.someodd.zip/
```

Test loading a Base64 encoded GIF (**darn this is currently still broken for me**):

```
dillo “data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhFAAXAPAAMf///wAAACwAAAAAFAAXAAACQISPqcvtD02YtFYV4EzZZtSBgMdJR2eV5jimJolebXzBsrRhJP6BXk6J+HqnW5E4M844uyPT5XzmhsLj71rDYgsAOw==“
```

There's also a Dillo config file...
