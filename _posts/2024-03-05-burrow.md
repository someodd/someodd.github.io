You may have heard of *static site generators*. You may even have heard of the [Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). But have you heard of a *static gopherhole generator?*

[burrow](https://github.com/someodd/burrow) creates gopherholes for you. It has
a lot of features to do so. It's so good, in my opinion, I'm considering
expanding the output to websites as well, or at least abstracting-out some of
its library components.

I got to work with the author
([@sternenseemann](https://github.com/sternenseemann)) of my favorite Gopher
Protocol server daemon
([spacecookie](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie)), who I believe I
have worked with on other matters as well.
