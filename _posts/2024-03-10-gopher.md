The point of this article is to get you browsing gopherspace quickly and to
share some of my favorite gopherholes...

## My software

Software I've made for the Gopher Protocol:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.tags contains 'gopher' and post.categories contains 'showcase' %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - {{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## Clients

### Lagrange

https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/

Here's how I set it up:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flatpak
flatpak install ./fi.skyjake.Lagrange.flatpakref
```

You may wanna run:

```
flatpak list
```

This is how to launch:

```
flatpak run lagrange 
```

at first you may get this at suome point:

```
$ flatpak run lagrange

Note that the directories 

'/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share'
'/home/tilde/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share'

are not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so
applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the
session is restarted.
```

just log in log out?

Try opening `gopher://someodd.duckdns.org:7070/1/`


### `gopher`

try `gopher -p "/" someodd.duckdns.org 7070`

## My favorite gopherholes

Of course my very own Gopherden forum: `gopher://someodd.github.io:7070/1/`!

  * `gopher://mozz.us/`: has some games, a flash archive, and other things. If
    you're using Lagrange they also have `gemini://mozzu.us/`!

## Also checkout the Gemini protocol!

I think the Gemini Protocol is worth checking out!
