## Chat, kinda everywhere and everyone

Modern and encrypted communication that everyone can own, instead of trusting some big tech giants. Communication that works like email--you can have an account on my server, but talk with someone on another server. Make voice calls, send files, create group chats, use completely different communication systems like IRC and Discord, all with XMPP!

Not only are you not locked into some big company for an account, but you can also use different apps to use XMPP! For example, on Android, I think [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) is very nice. On my laptop I use [Gajim](https://gajim.org/).

[I wrote some about my journey setting up this service](/notes/xmpp-server), so the setup is transparent, and I suppose in a way, open source.

My XMPP server is invite-only. It's linked to [my IRC server](/showcase/irc-server)!
