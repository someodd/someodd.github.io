You may have heard of *static site generators*. You may even have heard of the
[Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). But have
you heard of a *static gopherhole generator?*

[burrow](https://github.com/someodd/burrow) creates gopherholes for you. It has
a lot of features to do so. It's so good, in my opinion, I'm considering
expanding the output to websites as well, or at least abstracting-out some of
its library components.

Some highlights:

  * I got to work with the author
    ([@sternenseemann](https://github.com/sternenseemann)) of my favorite
    Gopher Protocol server daemon
    ([spacecookie](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie)), who I believe I
    have worked with on other matters as well.
  * I went out-of-my-way to have fantastic error handling in some respects
  * Had some fun with some very abstract features of Haskell, to me

## Example image

This is an example of a gopherhole generated with *burrow,* as rendered by my software [waffle](/showcase/waffle):

[The burrow repository](https://github.com/someodd/burrow) (hopefully) has an
example of a gopherhole that can be built with `burrow`.

## Example fonts

Here are some fonts that I and others have made for `burrow`:

## Story of development

I think I started developing this piece of software before AI started being
something I leaned heavily on in my development process. I think the code is
very clean, well organized/architectured, and well researched.

### Using abstract and advanced Haskell features

In this project I feel like I used very abstract and advanced Haskell features.

Here I will talk about the language extensions and documentation practices...

How I made my own markdown parser?

### Coming back to this project after a while

  * Needed to pin versions
  * Trying to get nix working
  * GHC versions...
  * cabal freeze, lock.nix
  * Removed depend marked as broken by nixpkgs, with code generated by ai
