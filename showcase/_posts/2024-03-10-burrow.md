You may have heard of *static site generators*. You may even have heard of the
[Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). But have
you heard of a *static gopherhole generator?*

[burrow](https://github.com/someodd/burrow) creates gopherholes for you. It has
a lot of features to do so. It's so good, in my opinion, I'm considering
expanding the output to websites as well, or at least abstracting-out some of
its library components.

Here's my gopherhole, which I built with burrow: gopher://someodd.duckdns.org:7071/

Some highlights:

  * Particularly proud of the code quality here, written mostly before AI
    became a big part of my workflow. Some examples:

   * [Some descriptive FrontMatter error handling](https://github.com/someodd/burrow/blob/dfecdace53504dfadda34f7d5717d14a763f373b/src/FrontMatter.hs)
   * [Getting abstract with the usage of `MultiParamTypeClasses`, `FunctionalDependencies`, `AllowAmiguousTypes`, and `FlexibleInstances`](https://github.com/someodd/burrow/blob/dfecdace53504dfadda34f7d5717d14a763f373b/src/Phlog.hs)

  * I got to work with the author
    ([@sternenseemann](https://github.com/sternenseemann)) of my favorite
    Gopher Protocol server daemon
    ([spacecookie](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie)), who I believe I
    have worked with on other matters as well.
  * I went out-of-my-way to have fantastic error handling in some respects
  * Had some fun with some very abstract features of Haskell, to me

The example:

## Serving/Docker Setup

I made [a Docker setup for
spacecookie](https://github.com/someodd/docker-spacecookie). It was nice
working with the author of Spacecookie on this project, and I think others!

I even made [a setup/branch specific to
burrow](https://github.com/someodd/docker-spacecookie/tree/feature/git-server-burrow),
which makes it easy to simply push a commit and the server rebuilds the
gopherhole for you!.

I think these setups were made originally around serving a Gopherhole via Tor
so I'll suggest some modifications.

### Using the burrow setup (no Tor)

I had to tweak the [Docker spacecookie burrow
setup](https://github.com/someodd/docker-spacecookie/tree/feature/git-server-burrow)
a bit to get it to play nice.

Using nonstandard ports.

Firewall for the gopherhole service:

```
sudo ufw allow 7071/tcp comment 'gopherhole (docker)'
```


Firewall for git/ssh, my rule makes is for only accessing via local network or my VPN:

```
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 2222 proto tcp comment 'gopherhole (docker) git ssh'
sudo ufw allow from 10.1.0.0/24 to any port 2222 proto tcp comment 'gopherhole (docker) git ssh'
```

also making it listen ssh different port! -- only allow from localnet ufw. had to edit docker expose, i also had to add this to dockerfile, modifying so this section looks like this (the sed command)

```
RUN apt-get install -y openssh-server
RUN sed -i '/^#Port 22/c\Port 2222' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RUN service ssh start


```

This is in my `~/.ssh/config` (`192.168.1.100` is the IP of my server, although
I realize now I want to modify this now to also specify the IP on the VPN too,
if possible):

```
Host gopherhole
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    Port 2222
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hgopher
```

I modified `make run` (`Makefile`):

```
docker run -d --restart=always --net servicenet --hostname=spacecookie -p 2222:2222 -p 7071:7071 --ip=172.18.0.68 spacecookie
```

Port forward on router, then it should all work.

Try to `git push` to the server IP hosting the docker container and also make sure you
port forward and you should be able to access...

## Example image

This is an example of a gopherhole generated with *burrow,* as rendered by my software [waffle](/showcase/waffle):

[The burrow repository](https://github.com/someodd/burrow) (hopefully) has an
example of a gopherhole that can be built with `burrow`.

## Example fonts

Here are some fonts that I and others have made for `burrow`:

## Story of development

I think I started developing this piece of software before AI started being
something I leaned heavily on in my development process. I think the code is
very clean, well organized/architectured, and well researched.

### Using abstract and advanced Haskell features

In this project I feel like I used very abstract and advanced Haskell features.

Here I will talk about the language extensions and documentation practices...

How I made my own markdown parser?

### Markdown parsing

### Coming back to this project after a while

  * Needed to pin versions
  * Trying to get nix working
  * GHC versions...
  * cabal freeze, lock.nix
  * Removed depend marked as broken by nixpkgs, with code generated by ai
