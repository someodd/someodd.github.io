title: 4-ch over Gopher

---


I wrote a tiny open source **4-ch.net viewer** that runs over **Gopher**.

The interesting part is the format.

It uses my *gopher applet* style:
a **README that is also a literate Haskell script**.
You run it directly:

    ./4_ch.md

No build system. No framework. Just `runghc`.

Writing it this way felt like a strange inversion of TDD.
Instead of tests, the README comes first.
The code exists to obey the explanation.

"README-driven design."

This works especially well for:
- small scripts
- teaching Haskell
- self-documenting infrastructure

It breaks down for large systems. That is a feature.

The applet plugs straight into **Venusia**,
speaks RFC 1436 natively,
and keeps dependencies close to zero.

A 2000s textboard,
viewed like its the 90s,
implemented like a literate essay.
