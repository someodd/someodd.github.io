I was interviewed again on Screwtape (an AnonrRadio program powered by SDF):

* Online archive of the interview: https://archives.anonradio.net/202511050000_screwtape.mp3
* Copy of the interview on my gopherhole, in here: gopher://gopher.someodd.zip/1/assets/posts/screwtape-interview-2025-11-04/

Some topics covered:

* Writing gopher apps easily with Venusia, porting software to Gopher
* [My Gopherspace RPG](/0/phlog/gopherspace-rpg.gopher.html)
* Haskell and Lisp programming languages
* How the people watching the show comment via a MUD (think: adventure game), which also has a built-in Gopher browser!
* Sentimental tech: tech as craft, art, intimacy with systems, and my upcoming manifesto/treatise/article, "we need to make tech into something warmer than just bits."
* Gopher, FTP history
* The logic of Gopher
* I talked about Category Theory (I'm no expert) and... MONADS.
