My server will be down on Monday, June 3, 2024 (USA). Basically all of [my services](/services) will be affected (XMPP, IRC, Whisper Radio, CS1.6, more).

I plan to use the downtime to install significantly more RAM and a GPU on the server.

This website should be unaffected. You may also want to see [my Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@someodd) and [my about page](/about).
