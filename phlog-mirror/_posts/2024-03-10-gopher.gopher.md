title: Using the Gopher Protocol

---


The point of this article is to get you browsing gopherspace quickly and to
share some of my favorite gopherholes...


## Clients

* sacc: like `gopher`, but maybe better. TUI.
* clic

### Waffle

I wrote a Gopher Protocol client called Waffle. Please [read my post about Waffle](/showcase/waffle).

### Dillo

[I wrote about Dillo in a separate post](/phlog/dillo).

### Lagrange (Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS)

[Lagrange](https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/) is a Gemini + Gopher Protocol
client (maybe more?) for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux, I think.

#### Linux (Flatpak)

Here's how I set it up:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flatpak
flatpak install ./fi.skyjake.Lagrange.flatpakref
```

You may wanna run:

```
flatpak list
```

This is how to launch:

```
flatpak run lagrange 
```

at first you may get this at suome point:

```
$ flatpak run lagrange

Note that the directories 

'/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share'
'/home/tilde/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share'

are not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so
applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the
session is restarted.
```

You may want to log in log out/restart session or something.

Try opening `gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:7070/`

### `gopher`

try `gopher -p "/" gopher.someodd.zip 7070`

## My favorite gopherholes

  * Of course my very own Gopherden forum: `gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:7070/`
    and my gopherhole built with [burrow](/showcase/burrow/)
    `gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:7071`
  * `gopher://mozz.us/`: has some games, a flash archive, and other things. If
    you're using Lagrange they also have `gemini://mozzu.us/`!

## Also checkout the Gemini protocol!

I think the Gemini Protocol is worth checking out!
