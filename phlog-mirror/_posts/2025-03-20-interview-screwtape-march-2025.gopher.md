title: My radio interview (Lispy Gopher Climate/screwtape)

---


On March 19, 2025, I did a radio interview with [screwtape](https://fosstodon.org/@screwtape@mastodon.sdf.org), on his "Lispy Gopher Climate" segment on aNONradio (hosted by SDF), about Gopher, a little bit about smallnet, Gemini, Bitreich, programming philosophy, and [The MADE](https://themade.org) (a museum I am making a documentary for). Screwtape has a segment on SDF's [aNONradio](https://anonradio.net/).

I was actually surprised by how enchanting the experience was. It reminded me of whimsical esoteric philosopher showmen that shall go unnamed, which was totally a vibe I was digging. I think I'm going to start following Screwtape's work. I really appreciate the artsy computing aesthetic. Relatedly, I noticed their avatar is by the [Unix Surrealist Tomas](https://fosstodon.org/@prahou@merveilles.town). I really appreciate his amazing dedication to hard computer science and historical archiving in the Lisp space.

Isn't this just the magic of smallnet, operating your own servers, federation, and all that?

Wow, what a wonderful letter! It feels very nice to be recognized by the smallnet community, especially the niches which share a lot of my aesthetics!
