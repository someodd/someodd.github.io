title: Applying to Avantos AI (job)

---


I saw a job listing on [Ask HN: Who is hiring (March 2025)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43243024). Seemed to be one of those fancy new cryptic challenge-based interviews.

At first I tried doing a command like this:

```
curl -X POST https://apply-to-avantos.dev-sandbox.workload.avantos-ai.net/ \   
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "my email"}'
```

That gave me a forbidden response. I was used to these, so I figured it had to do with blocking spammy-seeming requests. I neglected to read this part:

> You'll need to make sure the user agent isn't something too bot-seeming or WAF will block you. (Sorry we're a startup no time to fix.) This user agent works: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

So here I ran the command in verbose mode:

```
âžœ  post-apply curl -v -X POST https://apply-to-avantos.dev-sandbox.workload.avantos-ai.net/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:117.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/117.0" \
  -d '{"email": "my email"}'

Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

I opened up [the challenge link](https://fluttering-atmosphere-1b5.notion.site/Journey-Builder-React-Coding-Challenge-190d5fe264fa80cba39ec21afc6d42ec). It kind of seemed like they didn't want me just copying-and-pasting the challenge into Claude or ChatGPT or something because they disabled ctrl+a (maybe not intentional), so I also assumed there was more logging than that going on. So I used `wget` to get the web page and then fed it into Claude. I also fed the API documentation into Claude.

Seemed like a lot of work for a role I didn't want at all, but overall a fun little thing. Maybe a bit much to expect, though. Just thought I'd post here because I found it rather interesting.
