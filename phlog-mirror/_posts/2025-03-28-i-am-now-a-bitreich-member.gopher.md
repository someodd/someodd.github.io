title: I'm now a member of Bitreich!

---


I am now officially a member of Bitreich! I'll talk a bit about my membership and about Bitreich itself.

[Check out Bitreich's gopherhole](gopher://bitreich.org:70/1/)

I really admire the Bitreich group for being such a powerful and vocal, noticeable force for the Gopher Protocol in the modern era. I think I ran into their gopherhole randomly while surfing gopherspace. The Bitreich group carries a lot of the whimsy and not-taking-itself-too-seriously that you find surfing Gopherspace. For example, look at this joke about the excesses of the web made by *20h* on a Debian mailing list:

Of course, Bitreich has their own manifesto. Here's a quip:

> We  form  a movement to improve our daily software life. Software has to
> not misbehave, it has to follow our rules, it has to be reusable, it has
> to be easily maintainable, it has to provide its recompilable source and
> it has to be easily understandable.

I had been helping out tangentially by working on my Whisper Radio project, because they also had their own radio service.
I also have been working on uncovering history regarding the Gopher Protocol and working on a lot of Gopher software.

They gave me an SSH account which has some very interesting/fun services. For example, they have their own gopher service:

I'm very honored and happy to be an official member. I really admire the community vibes and their work.
