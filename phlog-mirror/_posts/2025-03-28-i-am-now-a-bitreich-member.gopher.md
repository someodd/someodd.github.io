title: I'm now a member of Bitreich!

I am now officially a member of Bitreich!

[Check out Bitreich's gopherhole](gopher://bitreich.org:70/1/)

I had been helping out tangentially by working on my Whisper Radio project, because they also had their own radio service.
I also have been working on uncovering history regarding the Gopher Protocol and working on a lot of Gopher software.

I really admire the Bitreich group for being such a powerful and vocal, noticeable force for the Gopher Protocol in the modern era. I think I ran into their gopherhole randomly while surfing gopherspace.

They gave me an SSH account which has some very interesting/fun services. For example, they have their own gopher service:

I'm very honored and happy to be an official member. I really admire the community vibes and their work.
