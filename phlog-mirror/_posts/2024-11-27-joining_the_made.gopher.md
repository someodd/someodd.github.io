title: 'Joining The MADE: Retro Tech Museum'

---


I have donated and am starting to volunteer at The Made, primarily remotely.

I donated a Packard Bell corner PC.

I'm proud to announce my membership with The Made video game (and computer?) museum! I plan to share my knowledge of Gopher and Haskell. I even have my own official museum email: someodd@themade.org. I came into contact with
them because I donated a Packard Bell "corner computer."

I have been working on a documentary for them, too.
