title: 'Exploring San Francisco''s Libraries: Richmond/Senator Milton Marks Branch'

---


This is part of my series on branches of the San Francisco Public Library system, which I explore through their "explorer map" program.

Please actually look through the gallery--there's a lot of photos that aren't shown in this post!
Hopefully the file names are descriptive enough.

## Explorer map

This would be my second sticker collected on my explorer map!

[The SFPL explorer map official web page](https://sfpl.org/sfpl-explorer-map) features "staff picks" of places to checkout near this library. For example, near the Richmond location:

* Boudin Bakery, 10th Ave and Geary
* Good Luck Dim Sum, 736 Clement St
* Rooster and Rice, 1 Stanyan St 
* Hard Knox Cafei, 2448 Clement St
* Taqueria Los Mayas, 331 Clement St
* Moscow & Tbilisi Bakery Store, 5540 Geary Blvd

## History

The staff at the Richmond library were kind enough to hunt down and print out a history sheet when I asked if they had historical info about the branch. It seems to be a printout of [the SFPL history page on the Richmond  library](https://sfpl.org/locations/richmond/library-history).

This branch was the 4th established in the San Francisco Public Library system. It was nominated, in December 2000, for designation as a city landmark.

There was a renovation which was completed on May 16, 2009. There's [an official SFPL page about the Richmond renovation](https://sfpl.org/about-us/capital-projects-building-you/completed-projects/richmond-renovation). Highlights include:

  * Building restoration
  * Additional library space
  * Dedicated teen area, expanded children's room
  * Study rooms
  * Two-story atrium

Art from Scott Donahue was added to the front. [SFPL PDF on Scott's art at this location](https://sfpl.org/sites/default/files/pdf/blip/richmondart.pdf).

## Culture

There seems to be a lot of Chinese language and culture here. In fact, I once took a Chinese calligraphy class here. There are lots of media (books, movies, magazines, newspapers) in Chinese. There were a lot of Chinese people there, too.

## Features

I really enjoyed the large tables with lamps that also function as outlets that I could plug my laptop into. Funnily enough, these lamps also have what seem to be CAT5e ports.

This library has a dedicated class room, a childrens room, a teen room, an entire fiction section, audio media (audio books, music on vinyl, probably more), as well as a lot of video media--especially a lot of Asian media (most notably Chinese).

## Aesthetics

This branch feels beautifully retrofitted and updated. Rather than intruding, modern furnishings of glass architecture compliment the beautiful wood work, ornate ceiling, arched windows, masonry, etc. Throughout the building cozy flourishes and even former details are upheld rather than hidden--like tiny little slit windows which are built around or even embraced and seen as a focal point like the little windows in the magazine room which ooks out into either ends of the modern extension of architecture. There are so many odd nooks throughout the building. Somehow, the building, no matter which odd corner you find yourself in, has a lot of light. 

It's wonderfully surreal seeing the preserved beauty of old up against the modern fixtures of glass. The whole library feels very open while having many nooks and crannies.

## Neighborhood

I explored the surrounding neighborhood after, especially following the recommendation section of the explorer map, which recommended Good Luck Dim Sum.

[Good Luck Dim Sum](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/I/assets/posts/richmond-library/good-luck-dim-sum-outside.jpg)

It's like a second Chinatown. I had some really fantastic dessert. I also went to a dim sum place recommended by the local library--good luck dim sum, which was delicious. I also saw that a new Chinese restaurant opened up: Lucky Food, which is kind of buffet/cafeteria style, it was pretty good. At Lucky Good all the tables were taken so I decided to ask some cute old aunties if I could sit with them, I got to practice my Mandarin with them, and talk about Jesus. They invited me to their Mennonite church. It was so cute. I forgot how much I love this area.
