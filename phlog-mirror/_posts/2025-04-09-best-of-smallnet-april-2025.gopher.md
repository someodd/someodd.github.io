title: 'Best of Smallnet Zine #0: April 2025'

---


This is the 0th edition of Smallnet Zine (April Edition). The point of this is to just blab about the state of the smallnet, indieweb, and self-hosting. Originally I had this idea to start something called netring.cafe, which was a cool idea, but I really already have too much on my plate at-the-moment. So now I'm just going to use a tag on my phlog to act as a zine:

[bestofsmallnet tag](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/1/phlog/tags/bestofsmallnet)

You should also check out my lawn for links. You can reach out to me to get your content featured there and see other people's cool smallnet/indieweb/self-hosted stuff there:

If you want to be featured just contact me or join my IRC/XMPP, just check contact section at the root of my gopherhole:

## Spotlight

I actually want to make an effort to archive these to:

[My person archive in gopherspace](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/1/archvies)

So keep an eye out for that...

### chud.cyou

This guy definitely has some kind of background in 4chan or imageboards. He actually hangs out in
[my IRC.](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/0/services/irc.md)

[Chud Airspace](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://chud.cyou)
Oldnet style website--actually kind of cool. He self-hosts various services, I believe, like the website, Mumble, a Wiki, git, an upload service called "UpChud." From what I've seen this website is pretty funny. To my surprise, I also find on his homepage he includes a link to me!

[CHudHome](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://chud.cyou/home.html)

He also has an IRC server at `irc.chud.cyou`!

## webamp

[Webamp](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://webamp.org/)

Classic webamp in the browser.

This isn't technically smallnet nor self-hosted, but I don't care and I'm featuring it here, anyway.

### Cameron's world

[Cameron's World](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://www.cameronsworld.net/)
A cool geocities-looking art project from what I can tell. Cool thing to explore.

### Mozz.us

This guy has some of the coolest content in gopherspace. He has games, a flash archive, etc. I believe it's all self-hosted.

[Mozz.us gopherhole](gopher://mozz.us:70/1/)

Another guy hanging out on my IRC server.

### Wired Sound

[WIRED SOUND](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://fauux.neocities.org/)

A neocities website that's an homage to Lain (a cyberpunk anime).

### htmlenergy

### Melon Land, Melon King

This guy is a indieweb artistic genius.

[MelonLand forums](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://forum.melonland.net)
This forum looks **amazing**. It's centered around indieweb type things. I talked to him about this in an interview and he said he found some really old software and themes.

[melonking website](gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/h/URL:https://melonking.net)
Amazing website, very artistic indieweb experience like none other.

## Some articles I've written on self-hosting
