title: Cashing out Monero in Debian

---


I was trying to get all of my XMR (Monero) sold, but this took some work on my
Debian server, as I hand't touched it in a while.

Useful commands:

```
sudo monerod --block-sync-size 50 --max-concurrency 4
wget https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/monero-linux-x64-v0.18.3.4.tar.bz2
sudo cp monerod monero-wallet-cli monero-wallet-rpc /usr/local/bin/
```

I had to make sure to update the Monero daemon and then get things sync'd
before I could use `monero-wallet-gui` again for transfers.
