title: I Made a Multiplayer RPG Where You Explore Gopherspace With Others

---


In this multi-player RPG, explore gopherspace with friends and strangers (work with them, kill them to steal from them) as you spelunk for hidden stat-boosting treasures hidden in the far recesses of unexplored gopherholes.

That's right, you literally crawl gopherholes' menus/files, looking for unlooted treasure. This treasure boosts your stats. You primarily use these stats to kill other users and steal their treasure. You can also leave comments.

The idea of this game is to encourage people to *really* explore gopherspace and to showcase how [Venusia](https://github.com/someodd/venusia) (my Gopher daemon) lets you, for example, run [Literate Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=Literate_programming) scripts, to give rich application experiences in gopherspace.

Play the game by finding the right link at [the root of my gopherhole](/)

# More info

The script is very half-baked and will likely need to undergo many iterations. The biggest glaring issue is that there's no password system so you can literally just type in someone's username to hijack their account.

At the moment, I don't really care as I'm busy with other things, but I will get around to fixing that. This just started off as a proof-of-concept of my Gopher state system/script.
