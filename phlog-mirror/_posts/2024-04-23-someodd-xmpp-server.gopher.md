## Chat, kinda everywhere and everyone

Modern, encrypted communication owned by everyone, not big tech giants. 

Voice and video calls, send photos and files, create group chats, and more.

Don't use text messages, Signal, WhatsApp, or Discord, use this service instead!

Like email you trust one email provider with your account, like `example@gmail.com`, but you can still email people who use another provider like `tim@apple.com`, except here we're talking about chat and calls.

You can use different apps to use this service. For example, on Android, I think [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) is very nice. On my laptop I use [Gajim](https://gajim.org/).

[I wrote some about my journey setting up this service](/notes/xmpp-server), so the setup is transparent, and I suppose in a way, open source.

My XMPP server is invite-only. It's linked to [my IRC server](/showcase/irc-server)!

## Tips

* You can join any [someodd IRC](/showcase/irc-server) channel from XMPP! Just try joining a room like `#main@irc.xmpp.someodd.zip` (if enough people want I may open it up to being able to join other IRC servers as well!)
* Gajim and Conversations support Jingle, which means you can make video and voice calls!

### My favorite clients

XMPP app for desktop/laptop (Linux, Windows, Mac): [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) (seen below, edited to respect privacy):
