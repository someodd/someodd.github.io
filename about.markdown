someodd is an alien who has landed in [esoteric netspace](/tags/gopher) in their UFO made out of [Category Theory and Lambda Calculus](/tags/haskell).

In their spare time they enjoy learning Mandarin, strength training, writing letters in American Penmanship, and baking cookies.

They like to consume old poetry and literature, old film.

I like to self-host various services, [I post about my services](/tags/my_servs), but also, I have an [official someodd services place](https://gopher.someodd.zip/1/services). I host Gopher, XMPP, [Counter-Strike 1.6](/phlog/announcing-counter-strike-16-weekly-event.gopher), [an automated radio service](https://radio.someodd.zip/).

Please drop by to say "hello" on IRC: [ircs://irc.someodd.zip](ircs://irc.someodd.zip) (port 6697, SSL).

[I have an about/contact page in gopherspace.](https://gopher.someodd.zip/1/about/)
