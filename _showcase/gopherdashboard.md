[gopherdashboard](https://github.com/someodd/gopherdashboard).

Some core things I learned or did:

  * systemd daemon managed
  * release management

Cool features:

  * Execute arbitrary commands if you want (flag to enable this not-so-safe feature)
  * Monitor arbitrary files
  * Configure through a JSON file
